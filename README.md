# OIB Mission Statement

Three year working mission statement for an Ops Incident Board (OIB)

### Proposal: 

Over the next three years, we should work towards having an elected, term-limited board of operations/software engineering professionals who are committed to raising the bar for industry incident reports, developing tools for reporting, and disseminating best practices and knowledge.

The OIB may provide:

* **Templates for constructive postmortems and incident response**.  Public git repo, perhaps a variety of templates for different types of consumers (e.g. other engineers, ecommerce customers) and degrees of badness (e.g. dipped below SLA, catastrophic data loss)
* **Publicly searchable database / aggregation of incident reports**, similar to the [NTSB database](http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/index.aspx)
* **Private peer review of post mortems** before public release, upon request.  Requires swift turnaround, but would be valuable to a lot of people who are inexperienced with this sort of thing and would like a review of their language and/or level of specificity.
* **Periodic [book reviews](https://github.com/Operations-Incident-Board/Postmortem-Report-Reviews) of recent or classic outages**, with an emphasis on what was useful about them and anything that was misleading or unclear.  The OIB will aggregate these on a central website, and have a rapid-release review of major outages.  The goal here is to help post-mortem authors understand the impact of what they are writing, and compare with precedent outages.
* The OIB will try to **signal boost best practices or interesting hacks** that an org is using to improve their reliability or human usability, so that other organizations may adopt the same pattern (e.g. Etsy's nighttime indicator in the deploy tool).  We want to encourage and amplify the beneficial networking effects of efforts like the Etsy-Twitter engineering exchange program.
* Ultimately: we would love to reach a point where we can **participate in post mortem discussions** at major tech companies -- as a fly on the wall to start, asking naive questions if that goes well, or even as a trained facilitator.  Tiny startups and nonprofits seem like a good place to start with this.  This won't work unless it becomes a badge of quality and credibility to publish a post mortem with an OIB stamp -- this means we certify it's a high quality, appropriately transparent post mortem that the rest of the industry should pay attention to and learn from.

Before we get anywhere near the last goal, we would need to build a name and credibility in the community by developing the first five points as well as a recognizable identity.  (Ideas for raising profile?  Possibly a VelocityConf panel or something next year.)

Practically speaking, the OIB should probably be an odd number of people (5?) where one rotates out every year and is replaced by community nomination.  It shouldn’t take more than ~2 hours of work per week per member, and there should be some continuity year over year.

_Better definition needed for high quality / certifiable post mortem.  We think it’s honest?  Enlightening or educational for others using similar software?  We def have to agree not to disclose anything the inviting company has not authorized.  Do we publish a separate meta-analysis, subject to their approval?_
